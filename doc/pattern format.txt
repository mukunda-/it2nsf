pattern format:

[byte:rows]

for each row:
  [byte:chflags1] [data for channels 0..7] [byte:chflags2] [data for channels 8..15]

                                           '---------------------------------------'
                                                              |
                                                              `-> only present if channel count is >= 8
   
  data:
    for each channel that is flagged:
    [byte:maskvar] [data...]
    maskvar=EVINevin
     n = new note
     i = new instrument
     v = new vcmd
     e = new effect+param
     N = entry contains note
     I = entry contains instrument
     V = entry contains vcmd
     E = entry contians effect+param
     
     (corresponding data follows)

  NOTE is same as IT note
  INSTRUMENT is same as IT instrument MINUS 1
  VCMD is same as IT vcmd
  EFFECT/PARAM is same as IT effect/param
